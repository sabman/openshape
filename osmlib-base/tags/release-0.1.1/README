== Dependencies

* libxml-ruby (for XML parsing)

Dependencies are not all installed automatically when installing the gem
packages because this breaks when the packages are already installed as
Debian packages.

== Usage

=== Basic OSM Objects

The library provides classes for the three basic building blocks of any
OSM database: OSM::Node, OSM::Way, and OSM::Relation. They are all subclasses
of OSM::OSMObject.

  # create a node
  node = OSM::Node.new(17, 'user', '2007-10-31T23:48:54Z', 7.4, 53.2)

  # create a way and add a node
  way = OSM::Way.new(1743, 'user', '2007-10-31T23:51:17Z')
  way.nodes << node

  # create a relation
  relation = OSM::Relation.new(331, 'user', '2007-10-31T23:51:53Z')

There is also a OSM::Member class for members of a relation:

  # create a member and add it to a relation
  member = OSM::Member.new('way', 1743, 'role')
  relation << [member]

Tags can be added to Nodes, Ways, and Relations:

  way.add_tags('highway' => 'residential', 'name' => 'Main Street')

You can get the hash of tags like this:

  way.tags
  way.tags['highway']
  way.tags['name'] = 'Bay Street'

As a convenience tags can also be accessed with their name only:
  way.highway

This is implemented with the method_missing() function. Of course it
only works for tag keys which are allowed as ruby method names.

=== The Stream Parser

To parse an OSM XML file create a subclass of OSM::StreamParser,
instantiate an object of this class and call its parse method:

  class MyParser < OSM::StreamParser

    def node(node)
       ...
    end

    def way(way)
       ...
    end

    def relation(relation)
       ...
    end

  end

  parser = MyParser.new('filename.osm')
  parser.parse

The methods node(), way(), or relation() will be called whenever
the parser has parsed a complete node, way, or relation (i.e. after
all tags, nodes in a way, or members of a relation are available).

The parser is based on the C libxml2 parser, which should be faster
then the pure Ruby parsers. It is a stream parser, so it will not
read in the complete file but give you the contents bit by bit.

=== Using a Database

If you want the parser to keep track of all the objects it finds in
the XML file you can create a OSM::Database for it:

  db = OSM::Database.new

The database lives in memory so this works only if the XML file is
not too big.

When creating the parser you can give it the database object:

  parser = MyParser.new('filename.osm', db)

In your node(), way(), and relation() methods you now have to return
+true+ if you want this object to be stored in the database and +false+
otherwise. This gives you a very simple filtering mechanism. If you
are only interested in pharmacies, you can use this code:

  def node(node)
    return true if node.amenity == 'pharmacy'
    false
  end

After the whole file has been parsed, all nodes with
<tt>amenity=pharmacy</tt> will be available through the database.
All other objects have been thrown away. You can get a hash of
all nodes (key is id, value is a Node object) with:

  db.nodes

Or single nodes with the ID:

  db.get_node(1839)

Ways and relations are accessed the same way.

When deleting a database call

  db.clear

first. This will break the internal loop references and makes sure
that the garbage collector can free the memory.
