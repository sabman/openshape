== Web

For more information see the OSM Library home page at
http://osmlib.rubyforge.org/ or the Rubyforge project page at
http://rubyforge.org/projects/osmlib/ . The OpenStreetMap web page

== Dependencies

* GeoRuby
* builder (for KML generation)
* osmlib-base
* gpx (Ruby GPX lib for GPX export)

Dependencies are not all installed automatically when installing the gem
packages because this breaks when the packages are already installed as
Debian packages.

== Supported Formats

This library can currently export into the following formats:

* KML (the XML-based format used by Google Earth and other products)
* ESRI Shapefiles (a very common GIS format)
* CSV (comma separated values, for use in spreadsheets or with UNIX
  command line tools such as +grep+ and +cut+)
* GPX (very preliminary support, needs patched version of ruby-gpx lib)

== Rules Files

OSM uses a very powerful data model with free tagging; other formats
generally have a stricter format. In most cases it is not possible to
convert OSM data into other formats without losing some information.
You'll have to pick which part of the information to retain and which
part you'll have no interest in. This is done with a "rules file"
which tells the library which OSM objects (with what tags) should
be exported into which destination objects (with what attributes).

Rules files always have a similar form, but contain some different
commands depending on the destination format.

See link:files/doc/rules-files.html for details about the format.

== Executable Usage

There is an executable 'osmexport' in the 'bin' directory. If you installed
this library as a gem it should have been installed in your path. If you
use the Debian rubygems package it will have been installed in
/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin or similar, you'll have to adjust your path or add
a symlink from /usr/local/bin or so.

Usage:

  osmexport RULEFILE.oxr OSMFILE.osm OUTFILE/DIR

For the KML export you have to use one .kml file as OUTPUTFILE. For the
CSV and Shapefile export a OUTDIR is given and the actual file names
are defined in the rule file.

== Library Usage

See the source of the executable for some ideas on how to use the library.
