= Export into CSV Files

CSV (comma separated value) files have records separated by newlines. Each
record contains several fields separated by a comma or other character.

Lets say you want to export certain amenities and create something like this:
 
  pharmacy|7.3213|53.2378|Becks Pharmacy
  hospital|7.2345|53.3442|St. Johns Hospital
  hospital|7.1453|53.2452|St. Mary Hospital

You have the type in the first field, then the longitude and latitude and
then the name.

In the setup section you define the filename, the field names and the
field separator character:

  setup :CSV do
    file :medical do
      name "Hospitals_and_Pharmacies"
      fields :type, :lon, :lat, :name
      fs "|"
    end
  end

Here <tt>:CSV</tt> is the type of export file, <tt>:medical</tt> is the
symbolic name of the output file for later reference. +name+ defines
the name of the output file, if you omit that, the name would have been
taken from the symbolic name, i.e.
"medical.csv" (<tt>.csv</tt> will always be added automatically). The
+fields+ line defines the symbolic names for the fields in order. And
with +fs+ you define the field separator (default is a comma).

Now you need the rules for the nodes:

  nodes do
    if amenity == 'hospital' || amenity == 'pharmacy'
      :medical << { :type => amenity, :lon => lon, :lat => lat, :name => name }
    end
  end

The important thing here is the middle line which says that you want
to add a line to the <tt>:medical</tt> CSV file with the value of the
amenity tag, the longitude and latitude and the name of this node. Use
the symbolic names you defined for the fields above, order does not matter.

You can define more than one file in your setup section and add nodes,
ways or relations to any of those files. That way you can export, say
some nodes into one file and some ways into another in one go.
