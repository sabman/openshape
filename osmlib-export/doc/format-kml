= Export into KML files

KML is an XML-based format originally invented for use with the Google Earth
program but now also used in many other applications. See
http://code.google.com/apis/kml for the KML documentation.

== Setup Section

In the setup section you define the folder structure of the KML file
including the names and descriptions of the document and folders and
the styles used in the folders.

  setup :KML do
    name 'OpenStreetMap'
    description 'Roads and parking lots'

    folder :parking do
      style do
        icon( :href => 'http://maps.google.com/mapfiles/kml/shapes/parking_lot.png', :scale => 0.7 )
      end
    end

    folder :roads do
      style do
        line( :color => '#f0f0f0f0', :width => 4 )
      end
    end
  end

Export goes into a KML file (<tt>:KML</tt>), the name of the document and
a description are defined. Then two folders with the symbolic names
<tt>:parking</tt> and <tt>:roads</tt>. For each folder a style is defined,
in the first case an icon style (for nodes) and in the second a line style
(for ways).

== Nodes/Ways/Relations Sections

In this case we want to add some parking lots in the nodes section.
Everything with the tag <tt>amenity=parking</tt> is added to the
<tt>:parking</tt> folder. We'll use the OSM ID as the KML ID and the value
of the name tag as name of the KML placemark:

  nodes do
    if amenity == 'parking'
      :parking << { :id => "n#{id}", :name => name }
    end
  end

And in the ways section we add all ways with any highway tag in a similar
way:

  ways do
    if highway
      :roads << { :id => "w#{id}", :name => name }
    end
  end

You can also set the description and the snippet:

  :roads << { :id => "w#{id}", :name => name, :description => "#{name} (#{ref})", :snippet => ref }
